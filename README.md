Comp Pract HW2 (here is also the HSB/RGB assignment:)

"Assignment: Rename the x and y variables h and s (for "hue" and "saturation"). In your README.me file, answer: what changes in the animation? What if you change them to nonsense names, like "dog" and "cat"?"

Nothing changed because we defined those variables to be the height and width, meaning those instances of the words in the code will reflect that they already have an assigned meaning.
